                        <p>Business cards are very common during any meeting and networking events, it is a quick and easy way for people to exchange their information and contacts. However, many people found physical cards are quite hard to organize, as it tends to lose and being forgotten, and it's very hard to find a specific card from many. It is also limited and outdated to share any useful information compared to today’s internet-enabled services like LinkedIn, making it harder and harder for those who would like to use a business card to showcase themselves and make themselves stand out.</p>

                        <p>With today’s advance in Augmented Reality and conversational AI technologies, we have found a way to utilize and merge these two technologies, adding a brand new experience on top of the physical business cards, providing much more information. Our project provides both android and web application service for people to view and share business cards using AI-powered interactive 3D AR avatar. The user can simply use their mobile phone camera to scan a unique QR code on the business card, instantly a vivid 3D Avatar will be overlayed standing above the card in Augmented Reality.
                            <br><br>Thanks to the powerful IBM Watson AI, the user can use their nature language to directly interact and ask questions with the avatar about anything they would like to know about the owner of the card, even creating interactive dialogs.</p>

                        <p>Everyone can register this service with their existing business card design, greatly extends the ability a physical business card can bring. User can make their own AR business card either in the app or in our web user dashboard. They can update their card details, design their own 3D AR avatar and easily view scan history and list of favourite cards everywhere without the app.</p>

                        <p>Requirement gathering is quite important for the project. We have conducted several interviews with our client, John McNamara, and prepared questions for the meeting. We have communicated both in person and through email, to gather the basic requirements and needs for the application and for how we should integrate IBM services into our project. Internally, we have then prioritised these requirements, and also conducted research on similar projects, to decide further what we should include. We have then designed our persona to think from user perspective and include anything we have missed.
                            Finally, we have designed a questionnaire to anonymously ask our peers as users, for any more functions they would like to add, the we have designed a mock interview and answer based on the information we gathered.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the end, we would design and prioritise these information once again, and design them into the MoSCoW list and user case diagrams. We then ask the client for any further suggestions on these, and change part of it if needed. During the complete development process, we would sometimes come back and change some requirements based on the technical possibilities and time.</p>

However it is difficult to find the certain information from traditional business card and physical business card is easy to lost and damaged. He would like to have a mobile app which help him store  and search information from cards. Also Rick would like to use linkedin to get more detail but not from normal website, He would like to try something new such as AR feature."

                        <p>IBM Watson Assistant is a quite matured machine learn conversational chatbot solution, which developers can train them using rules and word matches to program a model for recognizing user input and deciding what to do or reply. Watson Assistant is used commonly in website support chatbot, hotel, restaurant or flight booking systems. However, it hasn’t been experimented much in the field of AR and voice-enabled conversations. Our client would love to see us integrate AR with business cards and also utilizing Watson Assistant.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Hence our goals are, to make a mobile app that could display the 3D AR figure on top of a business card and precisely tracks the card’s location, rotation etc, making the AR figure realistic, to achieve this, we need to use Unity engine and Vuforia. To store different card detail, user profile and user favourites and browsing histories, we also need data storage and user authentication backend using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. Last but not least, we need to integrate IBM Watson services into our application for Natural Language Processing, and we also need to find a way to connect Watson into our data storage to grab the user profile data.</p>
